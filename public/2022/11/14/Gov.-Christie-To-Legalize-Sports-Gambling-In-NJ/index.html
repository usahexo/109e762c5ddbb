        <h1 id="Gov-Christie-To-Legalize-Sports-Gambling-In-NJ"><a href="#Gov-Christie-To-Legalize-Sports-Gambling-In-NJ" class="headerlink" title="Gov. Christie To Legalize Sports Gambling In NJ"></a>Gov. Christie To Legalize Sports Gambling In NJ</h1><p>On Monday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie announced that he plans to legalize sports gambling in the state. The move comes in response to a recent ruling by the US Supreme Court which struck down a federal law prohibiting sports gambling.</p>
<p>“I am excited to announce that I have signed Governor Murphy’s bill legalizing sports gambling in New Jersey,” Christie said during a press conference. “This is a victory for New Jersey and for freedom.”</p>
<p>Christie said that the state would begin accepting sports bets within two weeks and that regulations for the new industry would be released soon thereafter. He also predicted that the move would bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in new revenue for New Jersey.</p>
<p>Sports gambling has been illegal in most states since 1992, when Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA). But the Supreme Court ruled last month that PASPA was unconstitutional, clearing the way for states to legalize and regulate sports betting.</p>
<p>Several states have already announced plans to legalize sports gambling, including Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi. Rhode Island is expected to start taking bets within days.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports gambling argue that it will bring much-needed revenue to state governments and create jobs. Opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction and organized crime.</p>
<h1 id="Southern-Nevada-Casinos-Poised-To-Offer-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Southern-Nevada-Casinos-Poised-To-Offer-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Southern Nevada Casinos Poised To Offer Sports Betting"></a>Southern Nevada Casinos Poised To Offer Sports Betting</h1><p>Southern Nevada casinos are preparing to offer sports betting as soon as the U.S. Supreme Court decides on a pending case that could legalize gambling on sports nationwide.</p>
<p>The pending case, Christie v. NCAA, revolves around New Jersey’s attempts to allow sports betting at its racetracks and casinos. The state is arguing that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) of 1992, which barred states from authorizing sports betting, is unconstitutional.</p>
<p>In January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case, with a decision expected by the end of June. If the court rules in favor of New Jersey, it would open the door for other states to offer sports betting, including Nevada.</p>
<p>“There’s no question we would be ready to go if that happens,” said Tony Rodio, president of Tropicana Las Vegas and chair of the Nevada Gaming Control Board (NGCB).</p>
<p>Nevada is one of just a handful of states where casino-style gambling is legal. The state has a long history of offering sports betting and currently has about $500 million in annual bets placed on sporting events.</p>
<p>Sports betting is a major source of revenue for Nevada casinos; in 2017, it accounted for 8 percent of total casino revenues in the state. If legalized nationwide, it is estimated that sports betting could generate up to $6 billion in annual revenue for casinos.</p>
<p>While some states might choose to allow online or mobile betting, Nevada is likely to stick with its traditional model of allowing bets to be made only in person at casinos.</p>
<p>If the U.S. Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey and permits sports betting nationwide, it could be a major boon for Southern Nevada casinos such as Caesars Palace, Wynn Las Vegas and MGM Grand Detroit Casino who are well-prepared to offer this type of gaming option to their customers.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Poised-To-Approve-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Poised-To-Approve-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Poised To Approve Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Poised To Approve Sports Betting</h1><p>The state of Delaware is on the cusp of becoming the first state in the nation to approve sports betting. The Delaware Senate unanimously approved a bill on Tuesday that would legalize sports betting in the state, and the House of Representatives is expected to follow suit.</p>
<p>The bill would allow casinos and racetracks in Delaware to offer bets on professional and college sports, starting as soon as September 1. Bettors would be able to wager on games at physical locations as well as online.</p>
<p>Democratic Governor John Carney has indicated that he will sign the bill into law once it reaches his desk. “I’m supportive of it,” Carney said last week. “I think it’s something that we should do because it will create jobs and economic activity in our state.”</p>
<p>Supporters of legalized sports betting say that it could create more than 1,000 jobs in Delaware and generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state each year. The bill calls for a 12 percent tax on gambling revenues, which would be used to fund education initiatives in Delaware.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalized sports betting argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems. But supporters say that such concerns are overblown, pointing to research that shows that legalized gambling has not led to increased crime or social ills in other states.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of several states that are considering legislation to legalize sports betting following a Supreme Court decision last month striking down a federal ban on the practice. The court’s decision cleared the way for states to legalizes sports betting if they choose to do so.</p>
<h1 id="Wall-Street-Weighs-In-On-Legalized-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Wall-Street-Weighs-In-On-Legalized-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Wall Street Weighs In On Legalized Sports Betting"></a>Wall Street Weighs In On Legalized Sports Betting</h1><p>It’s been a little more than a week since the Supreme Court legalized sports betting and Wall Street is already weighing in on the potential for the industry.</p>
<p>According to a report from Mizuho, the market for legal sports betting could be worth as much as $7.1 billion per year. The report also predicts that the industry could grow at a rate of 20% each year over the next five years.</p>
<p>The news has sent shares of gambling companies soaring, with both Caesars Entertainment Corporation and MGM Resorts International up more than 10% in recent trading.</p>
<p>“It’s an enormous market, and it’s going to grow quickly,” said Steven A. Cohen, founder of Point72 Asset Management. “The dynamics are all good for this industry. There are 31 states that have some form of legal gaming and only four have legalized sports betting so far. So there is plenty of upside.”</p>
<p>While there is no doubt that the legalization of sports betting will be a boon for the gambling industry, there are some concerns about how it will impact professional sports leagues.</p>
<p>One worry is that fans will now have less incentive to watch games live if they can just place a bet on their phone instead. In addition, leagues could see their sponsorship deals decline as companies may not want to be associated with an industry that is now seen as being shady.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, most experts believe that the benefits of legalizing sports betting outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>“This has been a long time coming and it’s going to be very good for the economy,” said casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. “We are going to see more jobs and tax revenue come into states that legalize this activity. It’s a great thing for America.”</p>
<h1 id="Is-The-Future-Of-Gambling-In-Sports"><a href="#Is-The-Future-Of-Gambling-In-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Is The Future Of Gambling In Sports?"></a>Is The Future Of Gambling In Sports?</h1><p>The gambling industry is one that is always on the move, with new ways of betting and gambling popping up all the time. So, it’s no surprise that sports betting is becoming a bigger and bigger deal. In this article, we’re going to take a look at the future of sports betting and whether or not it’s here to stay.</p>
<p>For years, sports betting has been popular among those who like to gamble. And in recent years, it’s become even more popular, with more people taking part in sports betting than ever before. The reason for this is likely due to the fact that online sportsbooks have made it easier than ever to place bets. Not to mention, there are now more options for wagers than ever before.</p>
<p>It’s not just traditional bets that people are making either. In recent years, there has been a big increase in prop bets - wagers on events within a game that wouldn’t typically be considered bets, such as how many touchdowns a player will score or how many yards they’ll gain. This type of betting allows for more excitement and involvement in the game, which is why so many people are turning to it.</p>
<p>So, what does the future hold for sports betting? It’s hard to say for sure, but it’s clear that it’s only going to continue to grow in popularity. With so many options available for placing bets and so much excitement surrounding them, it’s no wonder that sports betting is becoming more and more popular every day.</p>
