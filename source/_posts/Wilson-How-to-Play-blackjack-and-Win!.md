#  Wilson: How to Play blackjack and Win!

Do you want to know how to play blackjack and win? In this article, I am going to teach you the basics of the game so that you can up your chances of winning.

The goal of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The object of the game is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21. You can hit (draw another card), stand (end your turn), double down (double your bet and get one more card), or split (split a pair into two separate hands).

When you are first starting out, it is best to keep it simple. Only make basic moves until you get the hang of things. Don’t be afraid to ask the dealer for advice if you are unsure what to do.

One of the most important things to remember when playing blackjack is that you should never go over 21. If you do, you automatically lose regardless of what the dealer has. So, be careful not to hit too many times if you have a high score – it might end up costing you!

Another key thing to remember is that dealers must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or more. This means that they are more likely to go over 21, so try to take advantage of this fact by betting big when they have low scores.

There are a few different variations of blackjack, so make sure you understand the rules before playing. Some variants allow players to re-double down after splitting, while others do not. There are also some games that use multiple decks of cards, which makes it slightly more difficult for players to win. However, with a bit of practice and some handy tips from this article, you should be able to beat any dealer!

I know that a lot of people out there are skeptical about playing blackjack online – they think it’s rigged or that the house always has an edge. But that’s simply not true!

So don’t be afraid to try out online blackjack – it might just be the best decision you ever make!

#  Wilson: My Journey from Amateur to Pro Blackjack Player

Like most people, I had always been fascinated by blackjack. I’d seen the movies and read the books, and I was intrigued by the idea of beating the casino at its own game. So, one day, I decided to give it a try.

I started out playing blackjack for fun, just like anyone else. But over time, I began to take the game more seriously. I studied strategy and perfected my techniques. And eventually, I started to win.

At first, my wins were small. But gradually, they increased in size until I was consistently winning hundreds of dollars each night. And that’s when I knew that I had what it takes to be a professional blackjack player.

So, in early 2017, I made the decision to become a full-time professional blackjack player. And it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.

Since making the switch, I’ve been able to make a good living from blackjack. In fact, over the past year or so, I’ve managed to win well over six figures playing blackjack online. Not bad for a “hobby”!

If you’re interested in becoming a professional blackjack player too, then here are some tips to help you get started:

1) Start by learning the basics of blackjack strategy. There are plenty of resources available online (including on this website), so there’s no need to reinvent the wheel. Just take your time and learn everything you can about how to play blackjack optimally.

2) Once you feel comfortable with basic strategy, start practicing your skills at home or in a live casino setting. This is important because it will help you get comfortable with the game mechanics and increase your chances of winning in a real-world setting.

3) When you feel confident enough, start playing for real money at an online casino. Be sure to pick a reputable site that offers fair games and generous bonuses/promotions. And always remember to stay within your bankroll limits!
