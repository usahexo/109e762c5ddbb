#  Cubs in control as Brewers, Cardinals struggle

The Cubs find themselves in control of the NL Central as both the Brewers and Cardinals struggle. Milwaukee has lost 5 of their last 6 games, while St. Louis has lost 7 of their last 10.

Chicago has been led offensively by Javier Baez, who is hitting .317 with 19 homers and 63 RBIs. Kris Bryant is also having a strong year, hitting .290 with 22 homers and 66 RBIs.

On the pitching side, Cole Hamels has been a big addition for the Cubs. He is 9-2 with a 3.32 ERA in 17 starts this season. Yu Darvish has also been solid, going 7-5 with a 3.81 ERA in 16 starts.

With the Brewers and Cardinals struggling, the Cubs look like they’ll be able to cruise to the division title.

#  Pirates find their groove, keep up with Cubs

After a sluggish start to the 2017 season, the Pittsburgh Pirates have found their groove and are now just two games back of the Chicago Cubs in the standings.

The Bucs got off to a tough start this year, losing their first six games and 11 of their first 12. However, they have since turned things around and are now 22-16 in their last 38 games.

Part of the Pirates' resurgence can be attributed to their resurgent offense. After scoring just 2.7 runs per game in April (second-worst in MLB), Pittsburgh has averaged 4.5 runs per game in May (ninth-best in MLB).

Leading the way for the Pirates' offense has been slugger Josh Bell. The 24-year-old is batting .292 with 10 homers and 31 RBIs this season. He has also shown some nice power potential, with an ISO (or isolated power) of .268 (the average major league ISO is .150).

Another player who has stepped up for Pittsburgh lately is 26-year-old outfielder Starling Marte. Marte is batting .325 with five homers and 21 RBIs this season and has also been a terror on the base paths, stealing 16 bases already.

With Bell and Marte leading the way, the Pirates appear to have a bright future ahead of them. And if they can keep up their current pace, they may just find themselves fighting for a playoff spot down the stretch.

#  Bucs surge ahead of Cardinals in NL Central

The Tampa Bay Rays have surged ahead of the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Central, and they show no signs of slowing down. The Rays are now 6 games ahead of the Cardinals in the division standings, thanks in part to their red-hot offense.

Tampa Bay has been one of the best teams in baseball this season, thanks largely to their potent lineup. Led by sluggers like JD Martinez and Austin Meadows, the Rays have averaged 5.9 runs per game this year. That’s good for 5th best in all of baseball.

The Cardinals, on the other hand, have been struggling offensively lately. They’ve averaged just 3.5 runs per game in their last 10 games, which is well below their season average of 4.7 runs per game. That’s not a recipe for success in a division that features the Rays and Milwaukee Brewers.

While the Cardinals’ offense has been struggling, their pitching has remained solid. Miles Mikolas and Jack Flaherty have both been excellent this season, and they could give the Cardinals a chance to make a run at the playoffs down the stretch.

But it appears that it’s too little too late for St. Louis, as they trail Tampa Bay by a considerable margin in the NL Central standings. The Rays appear to be headed for a playoff berth, while the Cardinals are likely to miss out on the postseason once again.

#  Reds fall out of contention; Brewers and Cardinals battle for second place

The Cincinnati Reds have been one of the biggest disappointments in baseball this season. After contending for the NL Central crown for the past few seasons, they find themselves out of the playoff picture with just a few weeks to go.

Meanwhile, the Milwaukee Brewers and St. Louis Cardinals are locked in a battle for second place. Both teams are 91-68 and trail the first-place Chicago Cubs by two games.

The Brewers have been led by their MVP candidate, Christian Yelich. The 27-year-old outfielder is batting .326 with 36 homers and 116 RBIs. He has also stolen 30 bases on the year.

Meanwhile, the Cardinals have relied on their pitching staff to stay in contention. They have the best team ERA in all of baseball at 3.34. Their top starter is Jack Flaherty, who is 13-8 with a 2.61 ERA.

It will be interesting to see which team secures second place in the NL Central and earns a spot in the playoffs.

#  Wild card race heating up in NL Central

The NL Central may be the most wide open division in baseball as the Wild Card race heats up. The Milwaukee Brewers have been the class of the division, but they are just a half game ahead of the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis Cardinals.

The Brewers got a big scare over the weekend when starting pitcher Jhoulys Chacin was forced to leave a start against the Cincinnati Reds with an injury. However, it turned out to be just a minor sprain and Chacin is expected to make his next start.

The Cubs have been led by their young stars, including Kris Bryant and Javier Baez. They are also getting good production from veterans like Anthony Rizzo and Jon Lester.

The Cardinals have been led by their pitching, which ranks first in the National League in ERA. Carlos Martinez has been their top starter, while Luke Weaver and Michael Wacha have also pitched well.

All four of these teams could make a run at the Wild Card, and it should be an exciting race to watch down the stretch.
