#  How have the Thunder fared in the playoffs?

The Oklahoma City Thunder have had an eventful playoffs. After losing in the first round of the playoffs last year, they made it to the Western Conference Finals, but were ultimately defeated by the Golden State Warriors. This article will take a closer look at how they did in the playoffs and what their chances are for next year.

In the first round of this year's playoffs, the Thunder faced off against the Utah Jazz. The series was tightly contested, with each team winning two games apiece. In the deciding game 5, Russell Westbrook led the Thunder to a victory with 43 points. In the second round, they faced the Houston Rockets. This series was also close, with each team winning one game on their home court and two games on the road. However, in game 7, James Harden erupted for 41 points as the Rockets advanced to the Western Conference Finals.

So what can we take away from all of this? The first thing is that the Thunder are clearly a good team that can compete with anyone. They also have two of the best players in the league in Westbrook and Durant. However, they do seem to struggle when it comes to closing out games and playing on the road. If they can fix those things next year, they will be a force to be reckoned with in the playoffs.
