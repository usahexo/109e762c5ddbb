#  Illinois is Considering a Tax on Gambling Devices

The state of Illinois may soon levy a tax on gambling devices, in an effort to generate additional revenue. The proposal, which is currently being considered by state lawmakers, would impose a tax of 10 percent on the net income generated by gambling devices. This could include machines such as slot machines, video poker terminals and electronic keno games.

 proponents of the proposal argue that it would help to offset the lost revenue from the state’s recent decision to impose a tax on income derived from gambling activities. opponents of the proposal, however, argue that it would do little to address the state’s budget shortfall and could actually lead to reductions in gambling revenues.

At this point, it is unclear whether the proposal will be approved by lawmakers. If it is approved, it will likely take effect later this year.

#  $1.5 Million in Gambling Devices Seized From Chicago Businessman

In a move that has sent shockwaves through the city of Chicago, authorities yesterday confiscated $1.5 million worth of gambling devices from a local businessman.

The businessman, who has not yet been named, is said to have been running an illegal casino out of his warehouse for the past several months. The raid was carried out after several weeks of undercover surveillance by the police department.

In addition to the gambling devices, officers also seized over $200,000 in cash from the businessman. He is currently being held in custody and is expected to be charged with several counts of illegal gambling.

This is not the first time that such a raid has taken place in Chicago. In fact, authorities have been cracking down on illegal gambling rings in the city for the past several years. However, this latest raid is by far the largest ever conducted in the city.

A spokesperson for the police department said that they hope this sends a clear message to all those involved in illegal gambling activity that they will not be tolerated. He added that anyone caught engaging in such activities can expect to face severe penalties.

Police Raid Illinois Gambling Device Shop

The police department in Springfield, Illinois raided a gambling device shop on Wednesday.

The raid took place after an investigation that began in September of last year. The department seized over 100 machines, as well as cash and other evidence.

Authorities say that the raid was a success and that it will help to crack down on illegal gambling in the area.

Those arrested in connection with the raid include the shop's owner and two employees. They are all facing felony charges of gambling and possession of gambling devices.

#  State Officials Eye Tax on Illinois Gambling Devices

As the state of Illinois continues to face significant financial challenges, state officials are eyeing a potential new revenue stream from gambling devices. Democratic state Representative Lou Lang has proposed a bill that would impose a tax on video gambling machines in the state. The tax would be 10% of the gross receipts from the machines, and would be used to help shore up the state’s budget.

The proposal has generated support from some lawmakers, but there is also significant opposition. Republican state Senator Kyle McCarter has been a vocal critic of the proposal, arguing that it will only lead to more gambling addiction and crime. He also points out that the state already collects taxes on casino and horse racing revenues, and that this new tax would be duplicative.

Supporters of the proposal argue that it is a fair way to generate additional revenue for the state. They say that the tax would only be imposed on those who choose to gamble, and that it would help to offset the costs associated with gambling addiction and crime.

The proposal faces an uphill battle in the legislature, but it could provide some much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state.

#  Illinois Gambling Device Retailer Fights proposed Tax

The Illinois Gaming Board has proposed a new tax on gambling device retailers, but one store owner is fighting back.

Gametech is a small business in downstate Illinois that has been in operation for over 20 years. It is one of the only retailers of video gaming terminals (VGTs) in the state.

Earlier this year, the Illinois Gaming Board proposed a new tax on VGTs. The tax would be applied at the point of sale and would be based on the number of machines a retailer sells.

Gametech owner Tom Mundell was outraged by the proposal.
"This tax would destroy my business," said Mundell. "It's just another way for the government to take more money from small businesses."

Mundell testified against the proposal at a hearing before the Gaming Board last month. He was joined by other business owners and trade associations who also oppose the tax.

Despite strong opposition, the Gaming Board voted to approve the tax in May. Mundell is now fighting to block the tax in court.

 Gametech employs 15 people and is one of the few businesses in its community. The new tax would put it out of business and cost those jobs.

"We are just trying to make a living here," said Mundell. "The government should be helping us, not taxing us out of existence."
