#  3rd time is the charm with Mummy Gold Game?

Mummy Gold is one of the older games that was ported to android. It is really a remake of an old arcade game with extra features and bonuses. But, is it worth playing?

The graphics are really nice for an older game and fit well with the theme. The gameplay is smooth and easy to control. However, the game can get repetitive fast since there isn't much variety in the levels. The bonuses are also hard to get and don't really add much to the game overall.

Despite its flaws, Mummy Gold is still a decent game worth playing if you're looking for something nostalgic or simple to play. Just don't expect too much from it.
