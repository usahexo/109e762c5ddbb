#  Get free carry out at a casino CQ9 with these simple tips!

If you're looking for a fun evening out, and some free food to boot, look no further than your local casino! Just follow these simple tips and you'll be enjoying a delicious free meal in no time at all!

Tip #1: Timing is everything.

The best time to get free food from a casino is usually on weekdays, around lunchtime or early evening. That's when the most restaurants are open, and they're more likely to be willing to give away leftover food. Of course, there's no harm in trying at other times too - you may just have fewer options.

Tip #2: Know where to look.

Not all casinos offer free food, so it's important to do your research before you go. Some of the most popular places for freebies include the buffet, the sports bar and the coffee shop. However, if you're feeling lucky, it never hurts to ask at other restaurants or bars too.

Tip #3: Be polite and patient.

Casinos can be busy places, especially during peak hours. So if you're looking for free food, be prepared to queue up (and be nice to the staff while you're at it). It may take a little while, but eventually someone will probably hand over a leftovers bag or voucher.

 Tip #4: Bring your own container.

One way to make sure you get your hands on some free food is to bring your own container! That way, you can easily take whatever leftovers the restaurant has to offer without having to wait in line again. Just make sure that it's a reasonable size - no one wants to carry around a gigantic tupperware box all night.
