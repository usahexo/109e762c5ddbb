Cleaning coins is a necessary evil for coin collectors. Not only does it make your coins look nicer, but it also helps to preserve them by removing any built-up dirt or corrosion. In most cases, this can be accomplished with nothing more than hot water, dish soap, and a little bit of patience. However, if you have a large number of coins to clean, or if they're in a particularly difficult position, using a washing machine can make the process much easier.



The first step is to gather up all of the materials that you'll need. For this project you will need: 
-One bucket or basin
-Warm water
-Dish soap
-A toothbrush or other small brush
- Qtips (optional) 
- Rubbing alcohol (optional)
- A washing machine 
- Coins 

Once you have all of your materials together, fill the bucket or basin with warm water and add enough dish soap to create suds. Submerge the coins in the suds and use the toothbrush or other small brush to scrub them clean. If there are any particularly difficult spots to get at, you can use a qtip dipped in rubbing alcohol for extra cleaning power. Be sure to rinse the coins well after cleaning them, and then set them aside to dry. 

If you choose to clean your coins in a washing machine, it's important to take a few precautions first. First, find an old towel or some other cloth that you don't mind getting dirty and place it in the bottom of the machine. This will help protect your delicate coins from getting scratched or damaged during the wash cycle. Next, fill up the machine with hot water and add just a touch of dish soap – too much soap can cause your coins to rub together and scratch them up. Put your coins in the washer and run a gentle cycle – avoid using harsh detergents or fabric softeners, as these can also damage your coins. Once the cycle is finished, remove the coins from the washer and allow them to air dry – do not use a drying machine or dryer sheet, as these can also cause damage.

Do you have a coin position washing machine Wilson but don't know how to beat it? If so, read on for tips on how to get the most out of your machine!

The first step is to make sure that you're using the right detergent. For best results, use a detergent that's specifically designed for high-efficiency washing machines. You can also try adding a fabric softener or fabric conditioner to your wash cycle. This will help reduce the amount of friction and agitation on your clothes, which can cause them to become worn more quickly.

Another thing you can do is to load your machine correctly. Make sure that you don't overload it, and try to evenly distribute the weight of the clothes across the drum. This will help them wash more evenly and reduce the risk of your clothes becoming twisted or tangled.

Finally, be patient! It may take a few cycles before you figure out what works best for your machine. Experiment with different settings and detergents until you find what works best for you.
