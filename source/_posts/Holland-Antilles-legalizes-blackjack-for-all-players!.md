#  Dutch Antilleans love their blackjack!

The Dutch Antilles has a rich casino history. The first casino on the island was built in 1972 in the capital of Willemstad. This small nation is located in the southern Caribbean Sea and is made up of five main islands, Curaçao, Bonaire, Sint Maarten, Saba, and Sint Eustatius. Each island has its own unique culture and attractions but they all share one common love – blackjack!

Blackjack is a popular card game that is loved by players around the world for its simple rules and exciting gameplay. In blackjack, the player competes against the dealer to see who can get closest to 21 points without going over. Players can beat the dealer by getting 21 points exactly (called a blackjack), or by having a higher score than the dealer without going over 21. If both the player and dealer have the same score, then it is called a push and no one wins or loses money.

In the Dutch Antilles, blackjack is very popular and there are many casinos that offer this game. Some of the most popular casinos include Spielbank Casino at The Marriott Resort & Stellaris Casino in Curaçao, Divi Little Bay Beach Resort in St. Maarten, Hilton Aruba Caribbean Resort & Casino in Aruba, Bucuti & Tara Beach Resorts in Aruba, and many others.
