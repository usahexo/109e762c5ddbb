#  AUDIENCE LOSES MILLIONS IN CASINO HEIST AFTER TRanquilizer Darts Fail To Put Down Security Guard

The security guard was not playing around. Even after taking multiple tranquilizer darts to the chest, he continued to chase the thieves through the casino, firing his weapon at them.

The result was a chaotic scene that ended with millions of dollars worth of losses for the casino’s patrons.

According to police reports, four men entered the casino early Sunday morning and made their way to the high-roller section. There they attempted to rob several people at gunpoint.

When the security guard arrived on the scene, the thieves began shooting at him in an attempt to make their escape. The security guard returned fire, but due to his being drugged with the tranquilizer darts, he was unable to stop them.

The men managed to get away with an unknown amount of money and left behind a scene of chaos and confusion. Dozens of people were injured in the crossfire, while others suffered from the shock of witnessing such a brazen crime.

“This could have been prevented if those idiots had just taken out the security guard,” said one patron who asked not to be identified. “I lost over $10,000 because of their incompetence.”

Casino officials are still investigating the incident and have yet to comment on what measures will be taken to prevent future thefts.

#  HIGH-STAKES ONLINE GAMBLERS ROBBIED AT CASINO DURING Blackout 

A group of high-stakes online gamblers were held up at gunpoint at a casino while they were in the middle of a Blackout game. The robbers made off with over $200,000 in cash and chips.

The incident took place at the Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City. The gamblers were playing a Blackjack game when the robbers entered the room and pulled out their guns. They ordered the players to hand over their money and chips, then fled the scene.

No one was injured during the robbery, but it was a frightening experience for the players. One of them, who asked to remain anonymous, said, “It was like a scene out of a movie. I’ve never been so scared in my life.”

This is not the first time that online gamblers have been targeted by criminals. In October 2017, two men were robbed of $100,000 while they were playing a poker game online. And in February 2018, a British man was kidnapped and held for ransom after he won $1 million in an online casino.

So why are criminals targeting online gamblers? One reason is that these games tend to involve large sums of money. And since casinos cannot always police their games closely, it can be easy for criminals to rob players without being detected.

Another reason is that many online gamblers are not familiar with local laws and regulations. This makes them vulnerable to fraud and other criminal activities. So it’s important for people who gamble online to do their research before choosing a casino site to play at.

The robbery at the Golden Nugget casino is another reminder that online gambling can be risky business. So if you’re thinking about trying your luck at an online casino, be sure to weigh the risks against the potential rewards.

#  $1M FOUND STOLEN FROM CASINO AFTER LIQUID tranquilizer GUN FAILS TO WORK 

$1M was stolen from a casino in Macau after a gunman attempted to steal the money using a liquid tranquilizer gun. However, the gun failed to work, allowing security guards to apprehend the assailant.

The incident took place at the StarWorld Casino in the early hours of Sunday morning, when an armed man entered the premises and attempted to steal money from a cashier’s booth. The gunman reportedly sprayed a liquid tranquilizer at two security guards, but the drug failed to take effect. The security guards then overpowered the assailant and detained him until police arrived.

According to local media reports, $1M was stolen in total. The suspect is currently in custody and is being questioned by police.

This is not the first time that a casino has been targeted by criminals in Macau. In February 2017, around $20M was stolen from the city’s Wynn Casino in a similar robbery involving a liquid tranquilizer gun.

#  DARTS OF DOOM: TRanquilizer darts intended to knock out security guard go astray in casino heist 

LAS VEGAS (AP) — A security guard was shot with a tranquilizer dart meant for him during a botched casino robbery in Las Vegas.

The incident happened Saturday morning at the Bellagio hotel-casino when four men attempted to steal an undisclosed amount of money from a gaming cage, according to the Las Vegas Sun.

Two of the suspects were reportedly carrying tranquilizer guns and fired at the guard, but the darts missed their target and hit him in the arm.

The security guard and a patron were both taken to the hospital with non-life threatening injuries. The suspects fled the scene and are still at large.

#  Casino Heist Goes Awry As Tranquilizer Dart Fails To Subdue Security Guard

The security guard at the casino was utterly unperturbed as the men in masks approached him, their hands held high in the air. It was clear that they had come for a robbery. However, when one of the assailants pulled out a tranquilizer dart and took aim at the guard, he simply laughed.

It soon became clear why he was so nonchalant when the dart failed to take him down. The would-be robbers were quickly dispatched by the guard, who showed no mercy as he beat them into submission. In the end, it was just a botched casino heist – and it could have easily been avoided if only they had chosen a more powerful tranquilizer dart.
